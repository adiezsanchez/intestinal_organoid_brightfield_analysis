# intestinal_organoid_brightfield_analysis

This repository contains a number of tools to speed up the interpretation and analysis of images from intestinal organoids acquired using a brightfield microscope. 

In order to run these Jupyter notebooks you will need to familiarize yourself with the use of Python virtual environments using Mamba. See instructions here: https://biapol.github.io/blog/mara_lampert/getting_started_with_mambaforge_and_python/readme.html

Then you will need to create a virtual environment using the following command:

<code>mamba create -n devbio-napari devbio-napari python=3.9 pyqt -c conda-forge</code>
